Site generation & Mars Robot Sample time calcuator:

    This folder contains two scripts, one with the purpose of generating data, and the other for using it. The data is then used to calculate the time it takes to travel between the different meteorite sites; whilst, taking a sample from each site.

    generate_sites.py:

        Is a python script that generates 5 random 'sites' into a dictionary, and writes them 
        into a JSON file. Each site has a unique geographical location, and composition.

    calculate_trip.py:

        A script that uses the JSON file generated by generate_sites.py, to calculate the total time 
        the robot takes to travel from original point 16.0, 82.0, to all 5 sites, and gather a sample
        from each site.

HOW TO USE:

    In order to use these scripts correctly, you have to call the generate_sites.py file first, then
    calculate_trip.py . The results then print in a mannner that's easy to understand.
